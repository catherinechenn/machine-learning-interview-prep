## Description

This repository explores the theory and application of statistical machine learning, focusing on statstics, bayesian and graphical model. Specific topics include Mixture models and the EM algorithm, Sparse linear models, Kernels, Gaussian Process, Adaptive basis function models, Variational Inference, Monte Carlo inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference, Clustering and Graphical models.

The repository follows the structure of two classical machine learning textbooks ([Machine Learning: a probabilistic approach](http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/)) by Kevin Murphy and ([Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/)) by Christopher Bishop.  I also include optional readings or videos as appropriate. Reference are listed [here](https://github.com/rain05680/MLaPP/blob/master/Reference.pdf).

## Software
This repository contains many demos of different methods applied to many different kinds of data sets. The demos are listed [here](https://github.com/rain05680/MLaPP/tree/master/RDemo). The vast majority of the code is written in R and Julia. Both programs are math based. Julia (like Matlab) is the go-to for designing algorithms (e.g. matrix operations), while R is great for data analysis and statistics.
